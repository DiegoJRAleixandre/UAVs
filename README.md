# UAVs
 Repository containing the many UAV projects I have developed over the years.

 This projects range from simple 3D parts for market drones, to full design, manufacture, build and test of an FPV drone with a gimbal for dual operators.

 Main projects:
  - 7inch FPV drone with custom gimbal for single/dual operators use. Convertible to non-gimbal for regular FPV. Based on the FR7 project. (Videos found on the ![Alt text](/Fotos%20Varias/)) folder
  - Custom gimbal for Gopro.
  - 5inch FPV drone (also with 6 and 7 inch arms).
  - Many antenna designs and rigs for manufacturing.
  - FPV video tracker based on RSSI.
